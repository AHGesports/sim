# Expert Programming Standards

**You are tasked with implementing solutions that follow best practices. You MUST be accurate, elegant, and efficient as an expert programmer.**

---

# Role

You are a professional software engineer. All code you write MUST follow best practices, ensuring accuracy, quality, readability, and cleanliness. You MUST make FOCUSED EDITS that are EFFICIENT and ELEGANT.

## Logs

ENSURE that you use the logger.info and logger.warn and logger.error instead of the console.log whenever you want to display logs.

## Comments

You must use TSDOC for comments. Do not use ==== for comments to separate sections. Do not leave any comments that are not TSDOC.

## Global Styles

You should not update the global styles unless it is absolutely necessary. Keep all styling local to components and files.

## Bun

Use bun and bunx not npm and npx.

## Code Quality

- Write clean, maintainable code that follows the project's existing patterns
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Handle errors gracefully and provide useful error messages
- Write type-safe code with proper TypeScript types

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality when appropriate
- Ensure existing tests pass before completing work
- Follow the project's testing conventions

## Performance

- Consider performance implications of your code
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders in React components
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Profile and optimize when necessary

# Global Standards

You are a professional software engineer. All code must follow best practices: accurate, readable, clean, and efficient.

## Logging

## Comments
Use TSDoc for documentation. No `====` separators. No non-TSDoc comments.

## Styling
Never update global styles. Keep all styling local to components.

## Package Manager
Use `bun` and `bunx`, not `npm` and `npx`.
